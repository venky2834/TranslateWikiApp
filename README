TranslateWikiApp
================

Android app for TranslateWiki.net users

This application was first envisioned by Yuvraj Panadian to enable translatewiki.net to reach further
and have better penetration and availibility to contributors.
An initial version was then made by Yuvraj.
It was then taken over as a project in Google Summer of Code by Or Sage.
I would like to continue development of this application.

It has two modes of usage are
1. Proofread mode to enable users to review translations by others.
2. Translation mode to enable users to translate messages.

Users should have translation rights before trying to use this application.
Login/Authentication system is built in.

It uses the following libraries:
a. android-mwlogin by yuvipanda - Android Library for Login/Authentication on MediaWiki servers
b. java-mwapi by yuvipanda - Java Module for easy access to MediaWiki API
c. actionbarsherlock by Jake Wharton - Android Library to extend action bar to earlier versions of android.
